""" ohd.py - (OverHead Door) is a complete re-write of my first completely useful Python utility.
My first project with a Raspberry Pi was intended to monitor a reed switch on my garage door,
and send me a text or email if it opened. That's not all it did, of course, but that's the gist.
It was finished in December of 2015, and ran flawlessly for three years.  The code was kludgy at best,
so I am re-writing it in an attempt to bring it more in line with good coding practices.  We shall see.
I am an amateur.  Learning as I go, I started on this in January, 2019.  Finished it on 01/26/19."""
